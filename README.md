**Shakespeare text using RNN :-**
- ```O what a mansion have those vices got , Which for their habitation chose out thee , Where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot , And all things turns to fair , that eyes can see !```
- ```my ife hath thought ( all naked ) will bestow it : Till whatsoever star that guides my moving , Points on me graciously with fair aspect , And puts apparel on my tattered loving , To show me worthy of thy sweet respect , Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee , Till then , not show my head where thou mayst prove me .```
- ``` which thou art too dear for To possessing , And like enough thou know'st thy estimate , The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing : My bonds in thee are all determinate .```
- ```The rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour , which doth in it live : The canker blooms have full as deep a dye , As the perfumed tincture of the roses , Hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly , When summer 's breath their masked buds discloses : But for their virtue only is their show , They live unwooed , and unrespected fade , Die to themselves.```
